## BBE: Basin-Based Evaluation of Multimodal Multi-Objective Optimization Problems

This repository contains the experimental pipeline and analysis for our paper. 

Automated algorithm configuration and optimization runs were conducted with help of a compute cluster running SLURM. 
We used [PALMA](https://confluence.uni-muenster.de/display/HPC/) the high performance compute cluster of the University of MÃ¼nster.
In case of need to reproduce the full experimental pipeline, please make sure to modify the scripts such that they can run on your compute environment.

## Procedure to fully run the experimental pipeline
```
cd experiments/01references/
./compute_references.R
cp refdata.Rdata ../../_shared/
cd ../../resources/algorithms
./distribute_shared_files.sh
#Now you can test if each algorithm works
cd ../../experiments/05lofconfiguration
./run_experiment.sh #Prepares all the configuration experiments
./joblauncher.py #Schedules all the configurations while keeping the joblimit under control
#Once all jobs are finished; do
./do_validation.py
#Once all jobs are finished; do
./make_result_table.py #this creates results.csv 
#Run the Jupyter notebooks in 'experiments/04configurationfast' to obtain the figures presented in the paper
```

Alternatively, just the `experiments/05lofconfiguration/results.csv` can be used to work with the provided notebooks.
